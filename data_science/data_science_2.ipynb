    "> There's a ton of data out there! How do I find the information I'm looking for? How do I understand it? And how do I make it relevant?\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, data science is the science of handling data in order to *answer a specific question*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows us to do this by providing us with tools for representing data, manipulating or selecting from it, analyzing it, and creating charts, graphs, maps, and other visualizations that display it. In this notebook, we are learning how to use these tools. (In the next notebook, we will take a closer look at gathering and cleaning data from various real-world sources so that we can put our skills together for a specific purpose.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* A1. demonstrate the ability to use different data types, including one-dimensional arrays, in computer programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A2. demonstrate the ability to use control structures and simple algorithms in computer programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* D2.2 demonstrate an understanding of an area of collaborative research between computer science and another field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "* I can choose and implement a structure to represent a dataset in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I can manipulate a data structure in code to select, organize, and analyze data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I can create a suitable visualization of a dataset in code in order to better understand a question.\n",
