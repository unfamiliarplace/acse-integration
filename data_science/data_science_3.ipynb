    "\n",
    "For both students and ourselves, an important question whenever we learn something is: \"Why are we learning this? What can I use it for?\" We've seen the basics of how to use the tools. As an English teacher I know likes to write in the margins of essays: \"So what?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a challenging question, but the beautiful thing about this stage is that you can open it to students. If they've been prepared well, then the applications should be limitless. In data science, that means you should be able to ask a lot of different real-world questions and get interesting answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's not always possible to come up with an interesting question from thin air. Often, the best questions actually arise from seeing something curious or encountering some underexplained data or hearing an anecdote and wondering whether it's typical or exceptional.\n",

    "### Narrowing down an interest\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choosing my data source:** As a Canadian with general interests, I'm going to start at StatsCan. One thing to keep in mind with them is that they have both public and private datasets. Many of the public ones are just snapshots from a single census, and the resulting table is easy to understand but not very deeply informative. However, they do have some datasets with longitudinal aspects, so I'll look for one of those that's more worthwhile throwing programmatic data science at.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploring data sets:** There are a lot of subjects on StatsCan: agriculture and food, business, children, construction, crime, digital society, economy, education, energy, families, health, and more. Seeing a list like this is wonderful since these are exactly the sort of prompts students need to lead their curiosity. In my case, I'll click on agriculture and food. It has a lot of datasets and an obvious interest. :)\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "This brings me to a set of about 650 items, of which almost 600 are data tables. I'll limit myself to those since those are the easiest way to ingest data such that we can work with it in code.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "That's a lot of tables to wade through, so I'll use the subcategory filter to limit it to food (130 tables). One of the top ones is \"Food available in Canada\" (in kilos per person per year). This sound vaguely interesting. Another one is [\"Supply and disposition of food in Canada\"](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3210005301), which sounds to me like how it was used, and thus a bit richer. I'll use that.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Preliminary skim:** As we saw in the last notebook, it's possible to preview datasets in Python using `pandas`, but since we want to get a sense of what's out there without having to download all these tables, I'll just skim through it in the browser.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "I click on \"Supply and disposition of food in Canada\". On StatsCan, you can choose various filters for the table views. Here I can choose one of many commodities, and I can choose a reference period. Wonder of wonders, the reference period lets me go back all the way to 1960! This is a jackpot dataset — lots to analyze. I can see that the resulting tables give me supply (broken down into stock, production, imports) vs. disposition (domestic disappearance, exports, manufacturing, and waste). I think this dataset will be worth poking around.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The resulting file, which can be found locally as well [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unfamiliarplace/acse-integration/main/data_science/data/32100053.csv), is about 10 MB with 16 columns and 70,000 rows for a total of ~1.1 million cells. (This sounds like a lot, but it's far from the largest datasets out there! But it will do fine for our purposes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning the data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why clean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we clean data? Because datasets that comes to us from the wild may have various formats (with inconsistent parsing rules), invalid data, missing data, and more. For example, suppose you had data from a number of volunteers who wrote down something like observations of birds with timestamps, but across your volunteers you find timestamps formatted as `3:01`, `3:01 PM`, `3:01 p.m`., `15:03`, `June 1 2023 3:03 P.M. EST`, and so forth. You would need to normalize them to one format so that they could be compared in analysis. Similarly, perhaps you have some numerical data on temperatures, but some of the rows fail to indicate whether the system was in Celsius or Fahrenheit and need to be thrown out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of StatsCan, the dataset already comes to us pretty \"clean\", with well-labelled and predictable formats, but it can still have missing data where there are gaps in their records (usually represented by `-` or `..` in their tables). It will also have a lot of extraneous data, e.g. metadata, columns linking the data with other records, or columns where every row has the same value (e.g. \"Canada\" because we downloaded a composite of all geographic regions).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to clean?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are essentially three ways to clean data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manually, using a text editor or dedicated CSV editor. For example, VSCode has numerous CSV extensions that let you add or reorder columns and so forth. (Note that while you can use Excel for this, it tends to alter your CSV format in ways you might not expect.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Via scripting that edits and resaves the CSV file. For example, Python has a built-in CSV module that we could use to read the file row by row, perform operations on rows and columns, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In code at runtime using table-oriented libraries like `pandas`, as we saw in the previous notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Pros | Cons\n",
    "| - | - | -\n",
    "| Manual editing | Requires less technical skill; fast to set up | Limited to find-and-replace or column/row-wise editing\n",
    "| Scripting using `csv` module | Relatively fast and powerful | No model, so somewhat unintuitive to edit data via indices rather than headers\n",
    "| At runtime in `pandas` library | Powerful and intuitive editing | May require pre-cleaning data; slower, is executed again on each run\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleaning, part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Our food dataset is sizable, and a quick glance at the table suggests that it can be trimmed quickly, so I'll do this in three passes: first with manual editing for the broad cleaning, then scripting, and finally with `pandas` at runtime for finer-grained selection from the trimmed dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll begin by making a copy of our `csv` with a different name, [`food_clean_1.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unfamiliarplace/acse-integration/main/data_science/data/food_clean_1.csv). We always preserve our original data in case something goes wrong, since our cleaning operations can be destructive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening it in VSCode's extension `Edit csv`, I see its 16 columns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "`REF_DATE,GEO,DGUID,Commodity,Supply and disposition,UOM,UOM_ID,SCALAR_FACTOR,SCALAR_ID,VECTOR,COORDINATE,VALUE,STATUS,SYMBOL,TERMINATED,DECIMALS`\n",
    "\n",
    "I need `REF_DATE` (the year), `Commodity`, `Supply and disposition`, and `Value`. The rest are empty, metadata, or repeated values. (Even `UOM` (unit of measure) and `SCALAR_FACTOR` (unit multiplier) are just \"Tonnes\" and \"thousands\" in every case, so they are needless on a row-by-row basis.) Incidentally, you might also wonder where the columns went that indicated finer detail like production, imports, domestic disappearance, and exports. It turns out that each commodity occupies up to 10 rows, and those finer details each have their own row. We'll deal with that later. For now, I'll just delete the unnecessary columns. Also, I'll rename `REF_DATE` to `Year`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's probably about all we can do with manual editing. Some of the things we'd like to be able to do as we skim through the resulting file (which takes up about 1/3 of the space).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert the rows into columns (since they consist of 8 identical rows that differ only in the value column)\n",
    "* Identify and possibly remove empty cells\n",
    "* Possibly eliminate data we're not interested in (this requires some thinking about what we want to do with the data)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleaning, part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the conversion of rows into columns. This is something that can be done fairly easily with normal Python logic, but would be somewhat involved if using `pandas` `DataFrames`, so let's use the second method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm will be to read each row, identify the first 2 columns, and create a row in a new CSV, and then append successive rows' \"Value\" columns until the first 2 columns change.\n",
    "\n",
    "One minor difficulty we notice as we skim the data is that not all commodities have the full breakdown. This means that we will need to read the label for the available data rather than just relying on an index. (StatsCan has provided somewhat \"dirty\" data, in that true predictability would have been to mark missing data with blank cells, but instead they omitted the rows altogether. That's what makes our job fun...!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some code to clean the CSV. It outputs [`food_clean_2.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unfamiliarplace/acse-integration/main/data_science/data/food_clean_2.csv)."

We probably do want to combine those if we want to do any comparison between foods, since otherwise we'll be comparing 1% skim milk against 3% skim milk and so forth.\n",

This is a great task to give a student or committee for half an hour or so — labelling underspecified data is an important part of preparing a dataset. A committee could provide some great discussion since they might disagree. For example, I included \"potato chips\" under vegetables along with potatoes, but someone else might put them under miscellaneous or junk food. And I put canned and frozen vegetables together with fresh, but an alternative study might explore Canadian trends between these specific categories, for example. (One could always produce multiple mappings for different studies of the same data.)\n",

It produces [food_clean_3.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unfamiliarplace/acse-integration/main/data_science/data/food_clean_3.csv)."
